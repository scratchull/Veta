## Inspiration
With diseases being such a major part of life and weak immune systems being common for parents and younger children, it is important that people are aware of diseases they may have come in contact with in order to have security and not know when itâ€™s too late, especially when the disease is preventable with early actions. COVID-19 has brought great stress to many and with some of the group members having family members who are of old age or of weak immune systems, it became more important than ever to be one step ahead of any disease that may come. Worries about if it was safe to go to a water polo meet, classroom, or picnic led to the decision to take the problem of disease awareness head-on.
## What it does
SickBook is a group-based social media application that enables users to be aware of diseases they may have come in contact with. A user in a group can alert other people in that group that the user learned he or she had a contagious disease such as strep throat without having fear of having any negative associations about them being created by their peers due to anonymity and the user does not have to worry about a third-party application storing or using their medical data as SickBook does not store that data. Also, in these times of transmittable diseases such as COVID-19, SickBook strives to make sure users are informed of all vaccination and testing centers near them and are marked on the map. Another issue SickBook solves is helping make sure mask mandates are met and people are wearing masks before they are permitted in either a public or private area and notifying the group of that. Any information that is stored in the Google firebase project is encrypted using AES 256.

## How we built it
1. Blank UI Design
2. AI Mask Recognition
3. User system with email and guest (fake user) system
4. Group System in-app and Firebase
5. Survey Design and Code implementation
6. Google APIs and Permission integration
7. Map marker clustering and Autocomplete search bar
8. Python and Java code integration
9. Self-reporting system and mask check system
10. Notification system with dynamic refreshing


## Challenges we ran into

- Simplifying UI Design
- Overuse of libraries
- Map permission errors
- AI system not working well with small images
- Group logic and making self-reporting easy
- Survey logic to decide if a group needs to be concerned
- Android App crashes due to many things on the map

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- UI Design
- Marker clustering system 
- Firebase usage
- Mask checking system

## What we learned
- Multiple tab UI design 
- Android app development
- Python and Java integration
- Google Maps and Places API
- Firebase Firestore in Java and Python

## What's next for SickBook: Social Media for Disease Awareness
- Fine-tune survey system
- AI mask recognition more efficient and more accurate
- Private user safe score that will "safe" a user has been
- Add more vaccination  and testing centers
